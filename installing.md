# Installation

## Requirements
1. Knowledge of how to use File Explorer.
2. Your Wii U's (modded with Aroma) SD Card.

::: tip
You can have several Aroma environments. This is not required but if you want a seperate environment for Pretendo and FakesomeFest you can do this. Consult a tutorial on how to do this.
:::

## Installing the plugin
First off, you're gonna want to get the [custom version](https://cdn.abmanagement.al/FakesomeFest.wps) of the Inkay plugin.

::: danger
Please uninstall Pretendo's Inkay before installing the custom one. Your Wii U may freeze and/or crash if both are present.
:::

After getting it, insert your Wii U SD Card and copy the `FakesomeFest.wps` file to `wiiu/environments/aroma/plugins`.
Eject the SD Card, and put it back into your Wii U. You are now ready for the second step.

## Applying Proxy Settings
This part is a bit more complicated.

Turn on your Wii U. If you had a Pretendo/Nintendo Network account, it won't work for now. Select an account you can use, make sure it has a saved password.

If it asks you for a password, just click the "back" button on the gamepad.

Go into System Settings, and navigate to `Internet` --> `Connect to the Internet` --> `Saved Connections` (X button). Here, you should see your Wi-Fi name. Click it, and press "Change Settings".

Navigate to the last tab, and click `Proxy Settings` --> `Use`.

### Proxy Settings:
IP/Address: `31.220.75.208`

Port: `8080`

Basic Authentication: Use

Username: `inkadia`

Password: The same as the username.

Once you have configured the proxy settings, run a connection test. If it succeeds, great! If not, contact us on [discord](https://discord.gg/mB5vJU6Zk7).

## Creating a new user
After this, you should be sent back to the user selection screen. You need to create a new user.

Go through the steps of creating a new user like you normally would.

::: warning 
DO NOT click "Yes" when it asks you if you have a NNID. This will cause a crash for whatever reason.

:::

## Deleting Shared Save Data
After setting up the new user, select it, and go back to System Settings.
Go into `Data Management` --> `Splatoon` and delete `Shared Save Data`.
Then, exit System Settings.

## Starting Splatoon
When you're at the Home Menu, select the new user and open Splatoon. If it hangs at the squid loading screen, go to our [discord](https://discord.gg/mB5vJU6Zk7) for support. If you are able to get to the tutorial, you have completed the guide!
